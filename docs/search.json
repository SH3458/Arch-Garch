    "text": "What does heteroscedastic mean?\n\nIt means that the standard deviations of a predicted variable are not constant over different values of an independent variable or over time.\nSo when the process is heteroscedastic (variance is not constant), it will follow heavy-tailed or outlier-prone probability distributions."

There is volatilit present which affects the model.\nSo in order to incorporate this conditional heteroskedastic in our model, we can create an AR (autoregressive) model for the variance itself."

The null hypothesis assumes ARCH(q) errors, while the alternative hypothesis suggests errors follow a GARCH(p, q) process."
